        <p>
            My name is Mauricio Barros, and I'm student at Seneca College of the Computer Programming and Analysis program. Dungeons and Dragons was first introduce to me when I was 10 years old by some older friends that played. At the time, the game was under it's second edition and learning it was somewhat more obscure than it is now.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason I chose this game for my final assessment of WEB222 is because of the amazing experiences I have had with it throughout the years. In this game you are able to share the experience of witnessing a story as it unfolds itself, while your character plays their part in it.
